<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

There are many great resources available online or on your mobile to learn languages, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create an application that let me save **relevant definitions and translations**, and allow me to practice effectively  -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Vocabulary is an essential part of learning a language
* A robust vocabulary improves all areas of communication â€” listening, speaking, reading and writing
* A larger vocabulary can be a stepping stone to higher levels of language fluency

Of course, no application will serve all people since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have have contributed to expanding this application! Hope you enjoy it as much as I do!

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With

Major frameworks that I built the project with:
* [Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/)
* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
* [Reverso](https://dictionary.reverso.net/)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Here is some instructions on how to set up the project locally.
Get a local copy up and running and follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

You'll need to have Python installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mathieu-calvo/Dico-App-Web-Scraping.git
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (example of how I do it, could be done differently)
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv 
   
   cd \venv\Scripts>
   
   activate
   ```
3. Install all dependencies into your virtual environment (I use pip)
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Launch the app locally
   ```sh
   python index.py
   ```
5. Go to URL indicated to see the app launched locally on your browser
   ```sh
   Dash is running on http://127.0.0.1:8050/
     * Serving Flask app "app" (lazy loading)
     * Environment: production
       WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
       Use a production WSGI server instead.
     * Debug mode: on
   ```
